# User Behavior Segmentation Demo

This repository showcases an end-to-end workflow for segmenting retail
customers based on transaction logs and simulated marketing touch points.  The
project is intentionally lightweight so it can be executed on a laptop while
still demonstrating multiple embedding strategies, clustering techniques, and
reporting utilities.

## Quick start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline**

   ```bash
   python -m src.main_pipeline
   ```

   The script generates:

   - `reports/summary_metrics.csv`
   - `reports/cluster_profiles.csv`
   - `reports/projection.csv`
   - `reports/insights_report.html`

3. **Launch the dashboard (optional)**

   ```bash
   streamlit run src/visualization/dashboard.py
   ```

   The dashboard expects the CSV outputs generated by the pipeline.

## Reproducing experiments

The `notebooks/` folder contains companion notebooks demonstrating exploratory
analysis, embedding experiments, and an outline for the Streamlit dashboard.

## Data

A small sample from the [UCI Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
is included for demonstration purposes.  Replace the CSV files in `data/` with
your own exports to run the workflow on real data.
